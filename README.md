# Intro component with sign-up form
Another challenge from FrontendMentor.io. My task was to build out a sign-up form complete with client-side 
validation using JavaScript and get it looking as close to the design pattern as possible. The sign-up form 
is responsive to screen size and contains interactive element with hover state.
